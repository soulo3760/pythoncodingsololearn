focus on  key-value pairs through dictionaries, exploring how to use them for effective data management and manipulation

Dictionaries are collection types used to store data in key:value pairs, 
  which are considered as items. They are ideal for organizing data into pairs, 
  where each piece of data (value) has its unique identifier (key).

product = {
  "name": "pen",
  "color": "red",
  "price": 79
}
print(product)

  OUTPUT
{'name': 'pen', 'color': 'red', 'price': 79}


contact = {
  'name': 'solomon',
  'number': 075656282
}


While strings are the most commonly used data type for keys,
other immutable types can also serve as keys. Values can be of any data type.

True or False: Lists can be used as keys in dictionaries.

focus on  key-value pairs through dictionaries, exploring how to use them for effective data management and manipulation

Dictionaries are collection types used to store data in key:value pairs, 
  which are considered as items. They are ideal for organizing data into pairs, 
  where each piece of data (value) has its unique identifier (key).

product = {
  "name": "pen",
  "color": "red",
  "price": 79
}
print(product)

  OUTPUT
{'name': 'pen', 'color': 'red', 'price': 79}


contact = {
  'name': 'solomon',
  'number': 075656282
}

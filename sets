Sets, unlike lists and tuples, are unordered collections. They are created with curly brackets { }.

guests = {'mercy','anna','mary'}
#######
Sets are unordered and don't support indexing or slicing.
################
Sets can't have duplicates, which is very helpful when developers need to ensure that each item in a collection is unique.
For example, in social media apps, your friends list should not have duplicates.
Adding duplicate items to a set doesn't cause an error; instead, it's ignored.

friends = {'Anna', 'Mery', 'Mery', 'Jonathan'}
print(friends)

output
OUTPUT
{'Mery', 'Anna', 'Jonathan'}

to remove or add we use add() and remove()
to remove all use clear()
The union() function called returns a new set with all elements from both sets, omitting duplicates.
set1 = {'apple', 'banana'}
set2 = {'banana', 'cherry'}
combined_set = set1.union(set2)
print(combined_set)

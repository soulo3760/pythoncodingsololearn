Sets, unlike lists and tuples, are unordered collections. They are created with curly brackets { }.

guests = {'mercy','anna','mary'}
#######
Sets are unordered and don't support indexing or slicing.
################
Sets can't have duplicates, which is very helpful when developers need to ensure that each item in a collection is unique.
For example, in social media apps, your friends list should not have duplicates.
Adding duplicate items to a set doesn't cause an error; instead, it's ignored.

friends = {'Anna', 'Mery', 'Mery', 'Jonathan'}
print(friends)

output
OUTPUT
{'Mery', 'Anna', 'Jonathan'}

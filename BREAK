The break statement is used to stop the loop when some condition is met.

This is very useful when searching for a specific item or condition, and there’s no need to continue once it’s found.
songs = ["Hello", "Yesterday", "Happy", "Hallelujah"]

for song in songs:
  print("Searching")
  if song == "Happy":
    print("Playing " + song)
    break

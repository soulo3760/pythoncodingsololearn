In programming, there is a paradigm that follows the same principle as blueprints and instances.
It's called object-oriented programming (OOP). 
In OOP, blueprints are referred to as classes, and the instances are known as objects.
class car:
  def __init__(self, color, brand, size, seats):
    self.color = color
    self.brand = brand
    self.size = size
    self.seats = seats
  
  def honk(self):
    print('beep beep!')

my_car = car('green','toyota','4wd', 5)
print(my_car.color)
print(my_car.seats)

my_car.honk()

OUTPUT
green
5
beep beep!

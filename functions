Functions that only work on certain objects (strings, lists, etc.) are called using dot . notation.

The capitalize() function will save you time when you need to convert the first character of a string to uppercase, while making the remaining characters lowercase.

The find() function checks if a character (or a pattern of characters) is present in a string. The function returns the index (position) of the given value. If the given value is present multiple times, the function will return the first occurrence (the lowest index).

len() is a very useful function that accepts a wide range of arguments. It’s not specific to any one particular data type or object, so you don’t use dot notation to call it.

Functions that only work on certain objects (strings, lists, etc.) are called using dot . notation.

The capitalize() function will save you time when you need to convert the first character of a string to uppercase, while making the remaining characters lowercase.

The find() function checks if a character (or a pattern of characters) is present in a string. The function returns the index (position) of the given value. If the given value is present multiple times, the function will return the first occurrence (the lowest index).

len() is a very useful function that accepts a wide range of arguments. It’s not specific to any one particular data type or object, so you don’t use dot notation to call it.

Select the correct way to call the len() function on a list named movies

len(movies)
movies.len()
The append() function is specific to lists. You must use dot notation to call append() on a list.

Write a line of code to call the append() function on a list named movies 
movies.append('thor')

insert() takes 2 arguments. The first is the index (where to insert) and the second is the item (what to insert).

Complete the code to insert Green as the first item in the list
items=['movie','song','music','fame']
items.insert(2,'child');
this adds child into the index 2 of the list 



Once a function has been defined, you can call it as many times as you need. This keeps your code short and easy to manage.

Choose the code to call the defined function

def greet(): 
  print("Hello from a function")
  print("Have a great day")

greet()

The body of a function contains the reusable code that is executed when the function is called. The code for the body of a function must be indented.
When a function is defined, you need to make sure parentheses () are added after the name. A colon : must be added at the end of the definition line.
Indentation, parentheses and the colon are needed for the code to run without errors.
You can define functions that take any number of arguments (including zero).  Arguments are put inside the parentheses () following the function name.

A function might require arguments to complete its tasks. Arguments are put inside the parentheses () following the function name.
py
#function definition
def personal_greet(name): 
  print("Hello", name)
  print("Have a great day")

#function calls
personal_greet("Sarah") 
personal_greet("Henry")

OUTPUT
Hello Sarah
Have a great day
Hello Henry
Have a great day

Functions must be defined before they can be called. 
Fix this code so it doesn't result in errors:

#function call
double(6) 

#function definition
def double(number): 
  print(number*2)

Here is the generic syntax and structure of a list comprehension:

cart = [x for x in range(1,51)]

<variable>: the variable that will store the newly created list
<expression>: an expression performed on each item. If no specific action is needed, the item itself is used
<item>: the current item being processed
<iterable>: any iterable object, such as ranges, lists, strings, tuples, and sets


#######
####
nums = [x*2 for x in range(10)]

print(nums)


### this multiplies the number within the range and stores it in the list

#########
nums = [x+1 for x in range(3)]
it adds 1 to the number and stores it in the lists

range() creates 10 numbers in a sequence, starting from 0.

range() generates a series of integer numbers. The i variable is used to iterate over the numbers.

You can replace i with any other variable of your choice.
# Loop using i as internal variable
for i in range(3):
  print(i)

print("--")   #This is just a separator

#Loop using "something" as internal variable
for something in range(3):
  print(something)


while
  When the condition no longer holds true, we exit the while loop.

seats = 300
while seats > 0:
  print("Sell ticket")
  seats = seats - 1
True or false: while loops repeat code whilst a condition holds.

False
True
ANS: True

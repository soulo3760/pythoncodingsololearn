In this lesson you will learn about lambda expressions - efficient feature in Python, 
allowing you to create compact, throwaway functions without needing the formal structure of a standard function definition.

Lambda expressions are functions without a name that are quick to create and use. 
They are written in just one line using the lambda keyword and are often used for small, simple tasks.

The power of lambda expressions becomes evident when working with data manipulation and transformation tasks.

In this lesson, you will learn how to effectively use lambda expressions with functions that are specifically designed for processing and transforming iterables.

Tuples, like lists, are ordered collections of items created with parentheses.

So, what's the difference between tuples and lists? Tuples are immutable.
They are useful when the data stored in collections shouldn't be accidentally modified during the program execution. 
For example, in a GPS navigation application, the coordinates of landmarks should remain constant

In Python, tuples are a fundamental collection type used for storing an ordered sequence of items that should remain unchanged.

to gather multiple elements from the tuple into a list. we use the * operator in tuple unpacking
scores = (98,91,88,64)
name, *rest = scores
print(rest)

The continue statement allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop when a certain condition is true.

In the code below, all ages from the list will be printed except those below 18.
  ages = [13,19, 22, 8, 75, 34, 26, 41]
  for age in ages:
   if age < 18:
    continue
  print(age)
OUTPUT

when is is useful to use continue

When continue is useful:
When you want to skip multiple operations inside a loop for certain conditions.

When the logic is more complex, and skipping early improves readability.

Example where continue makes sense:
python
Copy
for age in ages:
    if age < 18:
        continue  # Skip processing for minors
    register_voter(age)
    send_newsletter(age)
Here, continue avoids calling two functions for ages under 18.
